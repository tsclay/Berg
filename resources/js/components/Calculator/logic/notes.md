- [ ] Logic for Tn/TnI calculators in JS file; set up as classes!  
       - [x] Transpose  
       - [x] Invert  
       - [x] Normal Form  
       - [ ] Prime form
      </br>
- [x] Debug the Transformations class so that method calls and property calls don't contradict each other.  
       </br>
- [x] Debug scanForDuplicates function in the scanTest file so that it's returning the correct values  
       </br>
- [x] Implement recursion functionality to the scanFunction - [x] Research how to do this without stack overflow error
      </br>
- [x] Translator that takes the sets from the calc. and relates them to musical pitch-class labels  
       - [x] Set up an object for this  
       - [x] Set up one for enharmonics
      </br>
- [ ] Research machine learning for the respell method  
       - [ ] Need capability to respell notes that have much in common with common collections. (i.e., if most of the notes belong to the G minor collection, it would make practical sense to have the notes reflect that correlation)
      </br>
- [ ] Converter for notes to MIDI for exporting  
       - [ ] Incorporate jsmidgen lib to do this easily
      </br>
- [ ] Use <&natural;>, <&sharp;>, and <&flat;> for accidentals - [ ] Use <&#119083;> and <&#119082;> for double-flat and sharp
